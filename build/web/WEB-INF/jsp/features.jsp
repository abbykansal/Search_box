                be levied on every supply of goods and services. Centre would levy and collect Central Goods and
                Services Tax (CGST), and States would levy and collect the State Goods and Services Tax (SGST) on all
                transactions within a State. The input tax credit of CGST would be available for discharging the CGST
                liability on the output at each stage. Similarly, the credit of SGST paid on inputs would be allowed for
                paying the SGST on output. No cross utilization of credit would be permitted.</p>

            <div class="section-content">
              <p class="serif-font">The Centre would levy and collect the Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) on
                all inter-State supply of goods and services. The IGST mechanism has been designed to ensure seamless
                flow of input tax credit from one State to another. The inter-State seller would pay IGST on the sale of
                his goods to the Central Government after adjusting credit of IGST, CGST and SGST on his purchases (in
                that order). The exporting State will transfer to the Centre the credit of SGST used in payment of IGST.
                The importing dealer will claim credit of IGST while discharging his output tax liability (both CGST and
                SGST) in his own State. The Centre will transfer to the importing State the credit of IGST used in
                payment of SGST. <br> Destination-Based Consumption Tax: GST will be a destination-based tax. This
                implies that all SGST collected will ordinarily accrue to the State where the consumer of the goods or
                services sold resides.</p>
